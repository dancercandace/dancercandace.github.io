Ok! So I tried having an audience engagement day as described in the last post.

I didn't like it at all.  It was not fun.  

I blocked everyone.  Everyone who called without a request, wasted my time, and otherwise ignored my communications about what I want: Blocked, and good riddance.  I have no time for dead fish staring at me with their beady little eyes,

I like two things: I like lengthy, well thought out written communication, and I like money.  If you haven't got one of those two things for me, then just fuck right off.

Now I have to stop now with all video related tasks including taking calls, because my data for the month is almost done, even though I just renewed 3 days ago, fuck. What a sick waste of time, effort, and money this has been so far.
 
Losers!  Pathetic jizz soaked jerkoff artists!

But you know what's free: blocking people, so I'm gonna amuse myself doing that all day.

Those who have something I might like, please lay low for about a week, while I dispatch any of these sorry assholes who are fucking dumb enough to get my attention just now.  Once the herd's thinned out and it's a little more comfortable around here, we'll talk.

Thank you.  I'm Cynthia Christie
