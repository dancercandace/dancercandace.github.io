  	<p>Hello Gentlemen, my name is Candace.  I'm a friendly, sensuous, flirty, good-humored transgender woman.  I like men.  I like the sound of a man, I like the touch of a man, I like the feel of a man, I like the words of a man.  I look forward to providing
  	an enjoyable, sensuous, affordable viewing experience for my favorite people
  	in the world, male admirers of trans women.</p>

<p>Hello everyone, my name is Cynthia Christie, also known as Dancer Candace.  I'm a transgender erotic dancer.</p>
<br>

<p>Below you may find links to my Instagram featuring live performances, my Facebook page, and some legacy videos
and possibly some other trivia.  Thank you!</p>

<p>This is where the action is!  Below is a link to my Insta, featuring myself dancing live and naughtily many
times throughout the day!</p>

<p>Depending how the tips have been, of course.  Data costs.</p>

<p>Here's my Facebook.  Here what happens that'll probably be of most interest is that I currently take callers
from Facebook Messenger and give them their own little session during the insta show.  There's lots of people
over there, and a pretty lively bunch too!  Come join!</p>

      <section id="About_Me" class="main-section std-style">
      
        <header id="rates"><h2>About Me:</h2></header><hr> 
        
         <p>I'd like to share a little bit about myself with you.</p><br>
    
    <p>So guys, this site here isn't exactly an ad-infested, cross-linked, info-sharing,
    robot-crawling internet hellscape, I trust you've noticed.  It's a discreet little
    off-corner of the net coded by me with my modest programming skills.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I'm doing this for two reasons, first, I really enjoy the hell out of making the
    videos, and watching myself while I do it, and eyeing the camera, and thinking about
    who might be watching --hey, CIA, spread the word!!-- ...definitely all that, but the
    fact is that after trying to make a real go of it, I'm finding my former profession
    to be not that trans-friendly, so I need to branch out into other areas.</p>
    <br>
 
    <p>It does have to be said about what I'm doing here that it is sort of a way to be,
    you know, less of a burden on society.  I'm filming the videos on my laptop with
    a strobe light app on my phone in a corner of a shelter space that I'm trying to
    promote my way out of.  So, there's a little bit of "alms for the homeless" about
    this, and I'm sorry about that.  I thought it'd be better to try this than to sit
    on the sidewalk in the way with a cardboard sign.  I ain't beggin', I'm sellin', and
    I'm sellin' such as I need to, to get by!</p>
<br>
<h2><a href="https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=DXMRMH5D4MN9C">Please help Cynthia!</a></h2>
    <br>
    <p>Anyway, I hope you enjoy the videos.  The free samples are there for a reason, go 
    ahead and go play those as much as you like, or download them all, that's fine.  Do
    please consider treating yourself to a full show or two because they're lots of fun!</p>
    <br>
    <p>Thank you!</p>

        <header id="contact"><h2>Contact</h2></header><hr> 
      
      <p>So, be as it may that I'm a content provider on the Internet, I'm a friendly
      sort of girl, and certainly not opposed to some chit chat with those that find
      something to appreciate about me, particularly those who find themselves in Vancouver, BC!  I love you all!  So I do have my e-mail address
      available for ordering anyway, so if there's something you'd like to share with me,
      or chat about, or any questions, hit me up!  I'm friendly!</p>
